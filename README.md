# Convolutional VAE
A step by step guide for creating your very own variational autoencoder.

## Jupyter notebooks
[Jupyter notebook](http://www.jupyter.org) is a web application for running and sharing code and documentation in a user friendly and readable format. To start, run jupyter from the terminal (note: You should be in the folder where guide.ipynb is located, which should be the root folder of this repo):

```
(ml) $ jupyter notebook
```

If you open [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) you should see the file-structure of the folder where you run the command, and if any .ipynb-files (such as the guide) exists. Simply click "VAE guide.ipynb" to get started.

A readable WEB-version of the gude can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/epimedai/VAE/blob/master/VAE%20guide.ipynb).
